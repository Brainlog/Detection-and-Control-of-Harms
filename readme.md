## Detection and Control of Harms, Project for Ethics in Computer Science

* In this project we have tried to implement and analyse different state of the art bias detection
methods. 
* Some of the popular bias detection methods are WEAT (Word Embeddings Association
Test), Log Probability Score, and Stereo-Set. After this, we have also tried to implement a
debiasing method "Hard De-Bias" on some of the popular embeddings. 
* To test the debiased embeddings, we have implemented a counterfactual model. In this project, we are mostly concerned with Gender Bias. 
* All the implementations could be extended to multi class to tackle other racism and religion based biases.
